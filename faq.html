          <h3><b>
            What is the difference between psychotherapists and counselors who are licensed versus those who are not?</b>
          </h3>
          <p class="lead"><p class="lead">
            Licensed: Licensure is bestowed on highly educated and highly accomplished professionals by the Department of Public Health of the State of Connecticut. In order to qualify to sit for the Licensure.Examination, certain standards must be met. Individuals must have completed years of schooling and training culminating in receiving the highest university degree awarded in their discipline to practice psychotherapy. They then must participate in years of supervised practice of assessment, psychotherapy, and counseling.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p class="lead"><p class="lead">
            Individuals must then pass a comprehensive examination prepared by the Department of Public Health to ensure they have the knowledge necessary for psychotherapy and counseling. In most cases, they must participate in ongoing educational activities to keep their skills sharp in order to maintain their license.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p class="lead">
            Unlicensed: Unlicensed psychotherapists or counselors have no such standards required by them by the Department of Public Health. Licensure is Connecticutâ€™s method of protecting its citizens. Those psychotherapists/counselors without a license may NOT have the necessary education, training and/or experience to provide you with the care you need.
