            Robert S. Creal, Ph.D. American Psychological Association (Member)
          </h2>
            <p>
              Dr. Creal is a licensed psychologist who provides individual therapy and/or family therapy for adults, adolescents, and older children. He specializes in treatment of trauma, depression, anxiety, anger management, and relationship issues. He is also trained in EMDR.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dr. Creal did his undergraduate work at Syracuse University in New York, and his graduate work at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey and Auburn University in Alabama. He received his doctorate in Clinical Psychology (with an additional concentration in Child-Clinical Psychology) from Auburn University in 1981. He has been fortunate in that his career has allowed him to participate in varied and interesting work. His primary focus has always been direct clinical care including 22 years of inpatient work with adolescents and children. Also during this same time he maintained a private practice providing outpatient services to children, adolescents, and adults.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition Dr. Creal has served in clinical administration -- first on the Management Team (including a brief period as the Chief Executive Officer) of an adolescent psychiatric hospital, and later as a Clinical Manager in the Office of the Commissioner, Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services. In this latter capacity, he provided supervision, clinical consultation, and oversight for intensive community treatment programs working with young adults having severe emotional difficulties.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dr. Creal has participated in the training and clinical skill development of other psychologists. He developed and ran an adolescent rotation for pre-doctoral interns for eight years during the 1980s. From 1994 to 2001, he had an appointment to the Yale University School of Medicine as an adjunct Clinical Instructor to provide training and supervision to postdoctoral psychologists.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most recently Dr. Creal has maintained an outpatient practice in New Milford at the Interface Center.
